# Subjective Logic - Java
Within this repository is contained the source for [this applet](http://folk.uio.no/josang/sl/Op.html) for visualizing subjective logic networks. 

It is my only known copy of any implementation of subjective logic. Decompiled using [Java Decompiler](http://java.decompiler.free.fr/). All code is property of Simon Pope, Shane Hird and Matthew Davey.

This code is based on the source code of a Java applet that was previously available [here](http://folk.uio.no/josang/sl/Op.html), of which was provided to us under a CC-BY-NC-SA License by Audun JÃ¸sang.
This repository should be considered a fork of this code: we independently continued development of this library.
